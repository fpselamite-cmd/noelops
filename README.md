# NoelOps Grow Dashboard

A single-page dashboard (`index.html`) for tracking strain inventory, coca stock, grow locations, pot plans and 36-hour grow timers, with Discord harvest alerts.

## Live sync (everyone sees updates in real time)

Out of the box, data is saved in each person's browser only (the header shows **Local Only**). To share one copy of the data between everyone, with changes showing up on every open page within about a second, connect a free Firebase Realtime Database:

1. Go to <https://console.firebase.google.com>, click **Create a project** and follow the steps (Google Analytics is not needed).
2. In the left menu, open **Build → Realtime Database** and click **Create Database**. Pick the location closest to your crew and choose **Start in locked mode**.
3. Open the database's **Rules** tab, replace everything with the rules below, and click **Publish**:

   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       "noelops": {
         ".read": true,
         ".write": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Go to **Project settings** (the gear icon) → **General** → **Your apps**, click the **</>** (Web) icon, give it any nickname and click **Register app**. Firebase shows a `firebaseConfig` block. Copy it.
5. In `index.html`, find `window.NOELOPS_FIREBASE_CONFIG = {` (in its own block near the bottom of the file) and replace the `{ ... }` object with the one you copied. Paste **only the object**, not Firebase's `const firebaseConfig =` line:

   ```js
   window.NOELOPS_FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
       apiKey: "…",
       authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
       databaseURL: "https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
       projectId: "your-project",
       storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "…",
       appId: "…"
   };
   ```

   Make sure the object includes `databaseURL`. If it's missing, copy the URL shown at the top of the Realtime Database page. If this block is ever pasted wrong, the rest of the site keeps working and the header pill just shows **Local Only**.

6. Commit the change. The header pill turns green and reads **Live Sync**.

The first browser to connect uploads its current data to the empty database, so open the site first on the device that has the most up-to-date numbers.

### What is shared and what isn't

| Shared with everyone | Stays in each browser |
|---|---|
| Strain inventory and coca count | Uploaded logo overrides |
| Grow locations, pot plans and timers | Selected planner tab |
| Discord webhook URL | Admin login |

- Timers use the database server's clock, so every device counts down the same.
- `+100` / `-100` style buttons are safe to press at the same moment from different devices; both presses count.
- Each finished harvest sends **one** Discord alert, even with many pages open.
- If someone loses connection, their changes are kept and sent when it comes back (the pill shows **Offline** meanwhile).

### About security

The rules above let anyone who has the site's link read and change the data, and the Firebase config in `index.html` is public. That's fine for a private crew tool, but anyone who finds the link could edit or wipe the numbers, so use **Admin → Export State** now and then to keep a backup.

## Discord harvest message

**Admin → Discord Message** changes what the harvest alert says: bot name and picture, title, message, footer, side color, and whether the Postal / Pots / Ready At details are shown. Tags are filled in per harvest:

| Tag | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `{postal}` | Postal ID |
| `{alias}` | Location alias |
| `{duration}` | Timer length, e.g. `36h` |
| `{pots}` | Pot count |
| `{readyAt}` | Ready time in UTC |
| `{readyLocal}` | Ready time shown in each reader's own time zone |

The preview updates as you type, **Send Test** posts what's in the editor to your channel (even before saving), and **Reset to Default** brings back the original wording.

## Crew & permissions

In **Admin → Crew & Permissions** you can add crew members, each with a name and a 4-8 digit PIN.

- Until the first crew member is added, anyone with the link can use everything.
- Once there's at least one, everyone signs in with their name and PIN, and stays signed in on that device until they sign out (click the avatars in the header).
- Pick a role (Admin, Manager, Grower, Viewer) to start from, then tick exactly what each person can do: edit inventory, timers & harvests, grow planner, Admin page. You can also limit which locations (and the Main Stash) they see.
- People with no permissions (Viewer) only see the dashboard stats: no locations, timers or activity.
- Changing someone's PIN or removing them signs them out everywhere.
- The admin password always works on the sign-in screen as a master key.

This is a simple lock that stops casual misuse. Someone technical could still get around it, because the site has no server of its own.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. In the GitHub repo, open **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**, choose **main** and **/ (root)**, then **Save**.
3. After a minute the site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/noelops/`. It updates automatically every time something is merged into `main`.
